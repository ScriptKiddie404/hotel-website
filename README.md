# Landing page: Hotel HRM
## Autor: Efra√≠n Fernando Bejarano Puentes

This project is a web page (*landing page*) for a hotel site with the handicap of not implementing neither **FlexBox** nor **Grid** for the layout. This has the purpose of presenting the different elements that can be used when making layouts on web pages, as well as presenting the advantages that the modern CSS methodologies previously mentioned have.

This project has no complexity, if you want to see something more elaborate please consult the projects with a *framework* such as Bootstrap or check the sites made in PHP + Laravel, Angular or some other modern framework for frontend web development.

Please review the general portfolio to navigate through the various categories.
